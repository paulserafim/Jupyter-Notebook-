Once you’ve worked through the notebook, try going back and changing some of the values used, like the size of each random sample or the number of samples taken.  What effect does this have?  If you want to change the population mean from 165 cm to some other value, how many changes to the code do you need to make in order to accurately calculate and present the results?"

To do this, we might obtain the heights of a representative sample of women and calculate the mean height in our sample as an estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "We’ve seen that confidence intervals are a way for us to express how precise we believe our estimate to be.  To enable us to explore how confidence intervals vary from sample to sample, let’s assume for a moment that we know that heights of women in the UK follow a normal distribution with mean 165 cm and standard deviation 8.9 cm.  Of course, if we knew this we wouldn’t have to estimate what the mean height is, we’d already know.  But fixing what the true population mean is for a minute will allow us to explore how confidence intervals relate to the truth.\n",
